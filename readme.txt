Create links with a shortcode. It's that simple.

== Description ==

Create links with a shortcode. Comes in handy in places where HTML tags aren't allowed and/or keep getting encoded or something.

Basically, just a utility plugin.

Accepts 3 parameters:
* url
* target (automatically adds the leading underscore)
* class

Examples:
* [link url="http://www.nike.com/"]Just do it[/link]
	* Outputs: `<a class="tklink" href="http://www.nike.com/">Just do it</a>`
* [link url="http://www.pagelinestheme.com/" target="blank"]Open PageLinesTheme.com in a new window[/link]
	* Outputs: `<a class="tklink" href="http://www.pagelinestheme.com/" target="_blank">Open PageLinesTheme.com in a new window</a>`
* [link url="http://www.google.com/" class="googlie" target="parent"]A googglie Google link with parent target[/link]
	* Outputs: `<a class="googlie" href="http://www.google.com/" target="_parent">A googglie Google link with parent target</a>`

FYI:
*All links have a class of *tklink* added unless you specify your own class per link (see examples above)
*No styling of *tklink* or otherwise is added via this plugin.
*If you don't know what classes are, you can ignore. It's for styling (i.e. look and feel).
